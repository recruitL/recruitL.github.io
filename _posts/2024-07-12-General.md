# Effective one body

## PM动机
文章：[Damour](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00354)
1. A novel approach to the Effective One-Body description of gravitationally interacting two-body systems is introduced.
2. This approach is based on the post-Minkowskian approximation schemel (perturbation theory in $G$, without assuming small velocities), and employs a new dictionary focussing on the functional dependence of the scattering angle on the total energy and the total angular momentum of the system.
